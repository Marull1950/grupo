About
============
Sometimes we have to manage products for more than one website. This module helps to set multiple websites for each product. You can configure multi-website per product in a single click. You can manage multi-website under a single menu. We provide a mass update feature for multiple websites also, so you can update the multi-product for multi-website quickly.
